				<h2>Bloomstar Bouquet history</h2>
				<p>A brief history of the company. Bloomstar is a flower retail company that was founded in 2001 by Succar family. In 2015 Bloomstar acquired Ecuador farms, in 2016 it was time to be acquired by Elite Flowers which also has operations in the United States of America (USA), and in 2020 Bloomstar acquired Valley Flowers. Since it was founded Bloomstar grew from a small family-owned flower retail business to one of the biggest flower distributors in Canada. The rapid growth came side by side with the necessity of collecting, storing and analyzing information from their clients along with internal data related to production and sales.</p>

				<h2>Details about the flower market</h2>
				<p>Flowers require special care since it needs to stay alive from the time it is harvested until the client takes them home, but even needing a particular care flowers are not hard to sell. The product cannot be very expensive, it needs to be fresh and well presented to the client inside the supermarket. The not very expensive consumer indicator works mostly all year, but there are some special occasions like Motherâ€™s day, Christmas, Valentine's day, and Canada day, when the price substantially increases and clients overlook the cost and buy the product. These special days are very important for Bloomstar because it is when the revenues are higher compared to the rest of the year.</p>
